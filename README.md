# ADACS Face-to-Face training workshops

Throughout 2017 the Astronomy Australia Limited (AAL) initiative for Astronomy Data and Computing Services (ADACS) will deliver astronomy focused computing infrastructure, data services and expert training.

In this repository we have collected training material related to the different workshops offerd throughout the year.
The repo is organised by event.

Overall content will include:
* version control with git and github
* data analysis using python/pandas
* astropy tutorials
* Introduction to high performance computing on Pawsey Galaxy

For some tutorials a basic knowledge of python is assumed (i.e., you know the basic data structures and operations and how to write a script). 
Where possible training material will be uploaded as an ipython notebook and checked for python 2.7 and 3.X compatability.

If you want to downlaod a specific folder (e.g. the Pawsey Roadshow files) instead of cloning the entire repository you can use svn to checkout a subdirectory of this repository:

`svn checkout https://github.com/ADACS-Australia/Face-to-Face/trunk/Pawsey_Roadshow_MAR2017`

_Note_: you need to change the url of the folder by replacing tree/master with trunk
