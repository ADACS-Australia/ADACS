# ADACS

Throughout 2017 the Astronomy Australia Limited (AAL) initiative for Astronomy Data and Computing Services (ADACS) will deliver astronomy focused computing infrastructure, data services and expert training.

In this repository I am collecting training material related to the different workshops offerd throughout the year.
The repo is organised by event.

Overall content will include:
* version control with git and github
* data analysis using python/pandas
* astropy tutorials
* ?GPU processing on the Pawsey Galaxy supercomputer?

For some tutorials a basic knowledge of python is assumed (i.e., you know the basic data structures and operations and how to write a script). 
Where possible training material will be uploaded as an ipython notebook and checked for python 2.7 and 3.X compatability.
